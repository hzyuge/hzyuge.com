        excerpt: "Longjing is the proving ground for Hangzhou cyclists. 4.5km at 5% average gradient — it doesn't lie. Here's everything I learned from 50+ attempts.",

        content: `
            <img src="${IMAGES.cyclist_climb}" alt="Cyclist climbing hill" class="article-img-full">
            <p>If you ride a road bike in Hangzhou and haven't climbed Longjing, you're missing the local rite of passage. This climb doesn't care about your bike's price tag — it only cares about your legs and your lungs.</p>

            <h2>The Route</h2>
            <p>The climb starts at the Longjing Road / Manjuelong Road intersection and ends at the Longjing Tea House. 4.5km, 220m elevation gain, average 5% with sections hitting 12%. For beginners, it's serious but absolutely doable.</p>

            <h2>Gear Check</h2>
            <p>Before your first attempt, make sure you check these:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> The descent is more dangerous than the climb. Pad thickness > 2mm, linear lever feel.</li>
                <li><strong>Tire pressure:</strong> Front 90-95psi, rear 95-100psi. Too high = less grip. Too low = more resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Helmet:</strong> Non-negotiable. You'll hit 50+ km/h on the way down.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recommended Gear</h3>
            <p>If you're gearing up for hill climbs, here's what actually works:</p>

            </a>

            <h2>Pacing Strategy</h2>
            <p>The secret to Longjing isn't speed — it's consistency. I've watched too many people sprint the first kilometer and walk the rest.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First 1km:</strong> Keep HR at 70-75% max. Big ring, mid cassette. This is your warmup.</li>
                <li><strong>Middle 2.5km:</strong> Switch to small ring. Cadence 85-95 rpm. If HR exceeds 85%, slow down — don't stop.</li>
                <li><strong>Final 1km:</strong> Gradient eases slightly. You can push, but save something for the descent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Descent Safety</h2>
            <p>People underestimate the Longjing descent. Blind corners, occasional gravel, weekend tourist traffic. Three rules: brake before corners, eyes down the road, body relaxed on the bike.</p>

            <p>Cycling isn't just about reaching the top. Every breath, every drop of sweat — it's all part of the story. See you on the climb. 🚵</p>

        title: "Essential Cycling Gear for Beginners (2026): What You Actually Need",
        date: "2026-05-28",
        tag: "Gear Review",
        excerpt: "Overwhelmed by cycling gear options? After 5 years of riding, here's my honest list — what to buy first, what to skip, and where to spend your money.",
        coverImage: IMAGES.bike_gear,
        content: `
            <img src="${IMAGES.bike_gear}" alt="Cycling gear on workbench" class="article-img-full">
            <p>Every new cyclist asks the same question: "What do I actually need?" There's no single answer — a ¥60,000 bike and a ¥6,000 bike both get you moving. But some gear genuinely makes you safer and more comfortable without emptying your wallet.</p>

            <h2>The Essentials (by priority)</h2>

            <h3>1. Helmet — Budget $50-100</h3>
            <p>This is the one piece of gear you hope you never test. Look for: MIPS technology, proper fit, decent ventilation.</p>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087TKF1NM?tag=hzyuge-20" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">
                <span class="amz-icon">🛒</span> Giro Syntax MIPS Helmet — recommended
            </a>

            <h3>2. Bib Shorts — Budget $40-80</h3>
            <p>The most overlooked piece of gear by beginners. Good bibs make the difference between enjoying hour 3 and suffering through it. Look for: high-density chamois, breathable fabric, proper fit.</p>

            <h3>3. Bottle Cages + Bottles — Budget $10-30</h3>
            <p>Don't underestimate this. Riding an hour in summer without water is dangerous. A good cage won't eject your bottle on rough roads.</p>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RWX87L5?tag=hzyuge-20" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">
                <span class="amz-icon">🛒</span> CamelBak Podium Bottle — squeeze-to-drink design
            </a>

            <h3>4. Lights — Budget $20-50</h3>
            <p>Non-negotiable for night riding, helpful even during the day. Front: at least 400 lumens. Rear: multiple flash modes.</p>

            <h3>5. Gloves — Budget $15-30</h3>
            <p>Protect your palms, absorb sweat, improve grip. In a crash, they're your first line of defense.</p>

            <h2>Nice-to-Have (when budget allows)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clipless pedals + shoes:</strong> Noticeable efficiency gain, but takes getting used to.</li>
                <li><strong>Bike computer:</strong> GPS unit uses way less battery than your phone.</li>
                <li><strong>Jersey:</strong> Tight fit = less drag. Back pockets are incredibly useful.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>One thing to remember: gear is just tools. Your legs and consistency are what really matter. Don't let the gear nerds pressure you — just get out and ride.</p>

            <p>My alarm went off at 5:20 AM and I immediately regretted everything. I'd been too excited to sleep, finally crashing around 1 AM. But when I pulled back the curtain and saw the eastern sky turning orange, every ounce of fatigue evaporated. The Qiandao Lake loop I'd been planning for a year was finally happening.</p>

            <h2>Departure: Dawn at Qiandao Lake Town</h2>
            <p>Wheels rolling at exactly 6:00 AM. The lake was impossibly still, thin mist hanging over distant islands. Occasional egrets skimmed the water surface. Temperature around 18°C — perfect. The first 20km along Chunyang Road southbound were smooth asphalt with almost zero traffic. I averaged 28 km/h through this section, feeling unstoppable.</p>

            <img src="${IMAGES.group_ride}" alt="Cyclists on scenic road" class="article-img-mid">

            <h2>Unscripted: The Dog Chase</h2>
            <p>Around kilometer 45, passing through a small village, a large yellow dog bolted out of a courtyard and came straight for me. I'm not exaggerating when I say my cadence hit a personal record in those 200 meters — heart rate spiked to 180 instantly. The dog gave up after about 200 meters. I stopped, caught my breath, and laughed out loud. These "unplanned moments" are exactly what makes cycling stories worth telling.</p>

            <h2>The Climbs: Shangjiangbu Bridge Section</h2>
            <p>The climbing on Chunyang Road hits hardest between km 60-80. A series of rolling hills stacked back to back tested my endurance. I stopped at a roadside shop for water. The owner, a 60-something man, was fascinated by my road bike. We chatted for 15 minutes. He told me he rode an old steel single-speed from Qiandao to Hangzhou back in his youth — those guys were the real cyclists.</p>

            <h2>Fuel: What to Bring</h2>
            <p>Rest stops are sparse on the Qiandao loop. Pack these:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy gels x4 (one every 30km)</li>
                <li>Electrolyte tablets (you'll sweat more than you think)</li>
                <li>Bananas x2 (nature's energy bar)</li>
                <li>Snickers or Clif bars as backup</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Arrival: 2:03 PM</h2>
            <p>Back at Qiandao Lake Town. The bike computer read: 136.7km, 1,200m elevation, total time 8:03 (riding time 6:10). I sat on a bench by the lake, finished my last bottle of water, and watched the evening light paint the water gold.</p>

            <img src="${IMAGES.sunset_ride}" alt="Sunset over lake" class="article-img-mid">

            <p>That's the magic of cycling — the road beats you up, but when you look back, all you see is the view.</p>
